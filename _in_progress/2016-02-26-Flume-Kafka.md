In this post I will be discussing how to use Apache Flume and Apache Kafka, stating the advantages and disadvantages of each and also outlining their main use cases.

# Apache Flume

Flume is a distributed service dedicated to aggregating and transporting large amount of event data (namely log data) from many different sources into a central storage location. For the purposes of this blog, the central storage location will be a Hadoop cluster.

![Flume Architecture](https://flume.apache.org/_images/UserGuide_image00.png)

So what does this mean? Essentially, flume can efficiently stream data from a user defined source to a user defined target, continuously! This allows continued ingestion of data from a source that is always producing data, hence why log capturing is a main use case, however mining social media data is also a good use case.

## What is an Agent?

Flume data flows are defined as events and all events pass through an **Agent**. An Agent is a JVM process that contains a **Source**, a **Channel** and a **Sink** that all contribute to obtaining an event and storing it on the target data store.

Agents are configured using a configuration file that is like a Java properties file. This gets passed to the flume application as a parameter when it's started. An agent is started as follows:

`flume-ng agent -n <AGENT_NAME> -c conf -f <PATH_TO_CONF_FILE>`


## What is a Channel?

A **Channel** is used to stage events on an agent using an in memory queue. It has only one default property and that is its **type**. I will create a Flume configuration file to demonstrate how to set up a channel followed by a source and sink. 

```javascript
TwitterAgent.sources = Twitter  
TwitterAgent.channels = TwitterChannel  
TwitterAgent.sinks = HDFS  

TwitterAgent.channels.TwitterChannel.type = memory  
```
Here I have defined a **Channel** named *TwitterChannel*, a **Source** named *Twitter* and a **Sink** named *HDFS*. I will demonstrate how to configure the Source and Sink in the next few sections.

## What is a Source?

A **Source** referes to a data source that can be connected to using Flume. There are many different sources that can be connected to, for this example I will be connecting to Twitter.

Each source will have a different set of attributes that can be set. Some of these attributes are mandatory, others are optional meaning their default value will be set if they arent specified within the config file.

To connect to a twitter source first we need to obtain a set of keys by registering as a twitter app developer. This can be done by going to https://apps.twitter.com and creating a new app.

The mandatory properties for the flume source are: channels, type, consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken and accessTokenSecret. I set them like so:

```javasccript
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.type = org.apache.flume.source.twitter.TwitterSource
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.consumerKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.consumerSecret=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.accessToken=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.accessTokenSecret=0XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.maxBatchSize = 1000
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.maxBatchDurationMillis=100000
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.keywords= Hadoop, bigdata, spark, hive, Hbase, flume
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.channels=TwitterChannel
```

The **consumerKey, consumerSecret, accessToken and accessTokenSecret** should be filled in using the values given to you by Twitter. There are some additional settings that have been set: **maxBatchSize** means that upto 1000 tweets will be collected before being processed as a batch, **maxBatchDurationMillis** sets the max number of milliseconds to wait before a batch is considered done.


## What is a Sink?

Now I have connected to a data source, I need somewhere to write the data that it collects. A **Sink** specifies where the data obtained from the source should be output. This can be simply logged to the screen, written to the local filesystem, written to HDFS or many other alternatives.

I will be writing the Twitter data obtained to HDFS. The mandatory properties that need to be set to write to HDFS include: **channel, type, hdfs.path**. I set up my Sink as follows:

```javascript
TwitterAgent.sinks.HDFS.type = hdfs
TwitterAgent.sinks.HDFS.channel=TwitterChannel
TwitterAgent.sinks.HDFS.hdfs.path=/flume/events/twitter
TwitterAgent.sinks.HDFS.hdfs.fileType=DataStream
TwitterAgent.sinks.HDFS.hdfs.writeFormat = Text
TwitterAgent.sinks.HDFS.hdfs.filePrefix=twitter-test
```

The twitter data will be output to files that contain upto 1000 records (as specified by the source) to a HDFS directory named `/flume/events/twitter` as Text files. Each file will contain a prefix of twitter-test. When the flume application is run, we would expect files within hdfs like so:

```bash
$ hdfs dfs -ls /flume/events/twitter
Found 2 items
-rw-rw-rw-   1 training supergroup     384147 2016-03-01 13:36 /flume/events/twitter/twitter-test.1456868142401
-rw-rw-rw-   1 training supergroup     386884 2016-03-01 13:36 /flume/events/twitter/twitter-test.1456868142402
```

## Advanced

### Interceptors

Flume interceptors are useful when you want to apply a set of rules to modify or ignore data being ingested. This can range from adding header information, regex filtering and regex replacing. Interceptors are configured as a **Source** property, and one or more interceptors can be applied to a source by simply using a space seperated list. The order of list defines the order they are applied.

```javascript
TwitterAgent.sinks = HDFS
TwitterAgent.sources = Twitter
TwitterAgent.channels = TwitterChannel

TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.interceptors = twitIntercept1 twitIntercept2
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.interceptors.twitIntercept1.type = search_replace
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.interceptors.twitIntercept1.searchPattern = RT
TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.interceptors.twitIntercept1.replaceString = "Retweet"

TwitterAgent.sources.Twitter.interceptors.twitIntercept2.type = timestamp

...
```

The above configuration would look for any incoming tweets that contain the string 'RT' and replace it with 'Retweet' and also insert a timestamp in milliseconds into the event headers, containing the time at which the event was processed.
